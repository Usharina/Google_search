# Google_search
I've tried to code a little script in python that searches google in the terminal. And you can modify it and do whatever you want with it.

Clone the program in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/Usharina/Google_search.git

cd Google_search

install all requirements : 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
or
pip3.11 install -r requirements.txt

execute:
python3 Google_search.py
or 
python3.11 Google_search.py

It works for python3.9 to 11, you just need to install the packages and their exact version.
